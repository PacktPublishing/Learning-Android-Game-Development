## About the Book
In this book, we’ll start with installing Android studio and its components, and setting it up ready for Android N. We teach you how to take inputs from users, create images and interact with them, and work with sprites to create animations. You’ll then explore the various collision detection methods and use sprites to create an explosion. Moving on, you’ll go through the process of UI creation and see how to create buttons as well as display the score and other parameters on screen.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02. Chapter 1 does now have code as it has basic installation steps.

    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:id="@+id/TextView"
    tools:text="helloWorld"  android:textAppearance="@style/TextAppearance.AppCompat.Headline" />
```
